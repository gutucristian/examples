Imagine a user calls you and complains about a slow application (that you maintain).
What would you do to identify the problem?

We break our debugging into the layers of the stack of our application. First, we can
start with the front end and check if any of the APIs we are using are slow. We can
also do some code profiling to see which part of our code is taking the longest to run
to help us track potential issues in our logic. If the front-end is fine, we can look
at the database to see what queries we are making and if they are fully optimized. Are
we pulling unneeded information? If our back-end and front-end are fine then we can check
to see how we are serving our page. Are we minifying the HTML/JS/CSS? Are we loading scripts
before body? Lastly, maybe our app is not scalable. Maybe we need to scale it horizontally
by adding a load balance with additional worker nodes.
